This is my first lightest android app that I built using Java & most importantly the first app I built with my android Samsung cellphone!
Can you imagine!??
Java is so light that you can run it with 128mb ram properly! Where our generation cellphones have 1gb+ ram and let laptops!!!
#Instructions:-
You can download the app here from my github.
Since my app is not lisenced it will ask you to enable access from settings, then please allow it via settings, I promise no virus is here :') ita just because of not lisenced!
So can I say its safe!?
